                    <em>What is the difference between <strong>var</strong> and
                        <strong>let</strong>?</em>
                    <p>
                        The main difference is that <strong>var</strong> is function-scoped,
                        while <strong>let</strong> is block-scoped. Also, contrary to <strong>var</strong>,
                        <strong>let</strong> cannot be re-declare within the same scope. Finally,
                        <strong>let</strong> is not hoisted and is not part of the window object.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <em>What is the difference between <strong>var</strong> and
                        <strong>const</strong>?</em>
                    <p>
                        <strong>const</strong> shares the same differences than <strong>let</strong> within
                        <strong>var</strong>. Additionally, <strong>const</strong> cannot be re-assigned.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <em>What is the difference between <strong>let</strong> and
                        <strong>const</strong>?</em>
                    <p>
                        <strong>let</strong> can be re-assigned, while <strong>const</strong> cannot.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>What is hoisting?</em>
                    <p>
                        Hoisting meants that you can use a hoisted variable ebfore it's being declared,
                        because JavaScript moves all variable and function declarations to the top of the
                        current scope. However, the variable is not initialized, so it will return
                        undefined. While this is true for <strong>var</strong>, this is not the case with
                        with <strong>let</strong> and <strong>const</strong>.

                    </p>
